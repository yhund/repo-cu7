write documentation for these tests, but no longer than 2 paragraphs, 4-10 Sentences.

The provided suite of unit tests is designed to ensure the correct functionality of a form component in a React application. The tests simulate a user's interactions with the form, such as filling in the 'Name' and 'Email' fields, selecting the 'Agree to Terms' checkbox, choosing a gender from the radio buttons, and clicking the 'Submit' button. The tests validate both successful form submission scenarios and cases where the form should be prevented from submitting due to incomplete or incorrect information.

In the successful submission scenarios, different inputs, such as long names, complex email addresses, and gender changes, are tested to ensure that the form can handle a variety of inputs correctly. These tests also validate that the form correctly logs the submitted data. In the failure scenarios, the tests confirm that appropriate error messages appear when the user leaves a field blank, enters an invalid email address, fails to agree to the terms, fails to select a gender, or enters a name less than 3 characters long. In all cases, the expected outcome is compared to the actual outcome to ensure the component behaves as intended.

Also, write explanation how to run these tests locally

To run these tests locally, you need to follow these steps:

    Install Node.js and npm: Ensure that you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your local machine. You can download Node.js from their official website and npm comes bundled with it.

    Clone the repository: Clone the project repository to your local machine using git. Open a terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository and run the command: git clone <repository_url>.

    Navigate to the project directory: Use the command cd <your_project_directory> to navigate into the project directory.

    Install the dependencies: In the project directory, you should see a file called package.json which contains all the dependencies of your project. To install these dependencies, run the command npm install.

    Run the tests: The tests can be run using Jest, which is often used in conjunction with the React Testing Library. If your project is set up to use Jest (look for it in your package.json), you can use the command npm test to run your test suite. This will start Jest and it will automatically find and execute all test files in your project.

Ensure your terminal is open and active during the testing process as test results will be printed there. If everything is set up correctly, you should see output indicating whether your tests passed or failed.

Remember, any changes you make to your tests or components will require you to re-run the tests to see the results of your changes.
